This is a group project done to research the software design. The project was conducted on behalf of a client, Trafford Pharmaceuticals. The objectives were to collaborate with the client on their requirements for a functional management system that oversees inventory management, syncs sales to current inventory levels in real time and finally ensures that dangerous drugs are administered appropriately. The Medical sector is tightly regulated and thus, the management system needs to assist the client to meet their operational requirements as they expand reliably. Currently, Trafford Pharmaceuticals are running outdated systems that operate as separate procedures. These procedures must be manually synchronised which is inefficient and leaves the firm exposed to risks of human error. The proposed management system seeks to solve these issues and improve efficiency (Koch, 2005).
