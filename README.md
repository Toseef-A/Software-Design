Trafford Pharmaceuticals Management System

This project, developed as part of a module assignment at University Academy 92 for my bachelor's degree, aims to create a comprehensive management system for an imagenary  company called Trafford Pharmaceuticals. The system will streamline inventory management, synchronize sales with current inventory levels in real-time, and ensure the appropriate administration of drugs. The current manual procedures are outdated and prone to errors, posing risks to the firm's operations. By collaborating with Trafford Pharmaceuticals, our objective is to create a robust system that meets their operational requirements and enhances efficiency.
